# 🚀 Live Coding Platform

Real-time collaborative coding environment built with Typescript, WebSockets, Judge0 API, and PostgreSQL.

📌 Overview
This platform allows multiple users to solve coding problems together in real-time. Built for mock interviews and coding practice, it features live code execution, synchronized sessions, and a shared problem-solving environment.

🛠️ Tech Stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, Judge0 API

💡 Features
🔄 Real-time Collaboration: Edit and run code simultaneously across multiple users using WebSocket communication.

💻 Multi-language Support: Compile code in various programming languages via Judge0 API.

🧠 Interview Questions: Practice LeetCode-style challenges with friends.

🧪 Used in live mock interviews with consistent low-latency performance.

🏆 Leaderboard System: Tracks user sessions and scores to encourage engagement.

⚙️ Tech Highlights
